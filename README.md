This repository demonstrates a common error in implementing the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). The original code contains a subtle flaw that leads to incorrect results for some input values. The corrected version provides a robust implementation of the algorithm.  The bug is related to incorrect base case handling in the recursive GCD calculation.
